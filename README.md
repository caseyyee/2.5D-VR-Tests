**[BEST ONLINE DEMO SO FAR](http://ncase.me/2.5D-VR-Tests/animatic_test_2)** (as of Feb 18th, 2015)    
works in Google Cardboard, too.

So I just came up with the most beautiful and ugly workflow.
I made something that converts 2D Flash to 2.5D WebGL Virtual Reality!
It goes from something like this...

...to this...

...*automatically*. As in, I don't even need to export PNGs or spritesheets,
I just hit "Publish Movie" in Adobe Flash CC, and voila. It just works!
(unless it doesn't)

**How it's done, more or less:**

1. Create animation in Adobe Flash, with some special setup.
2. Export as HTML5 using [CreateJS](http://createjs.com/).
3. Take the HTML5 export data/code and put it into [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/).
4. Cram it all into [Smus's Responsive VR](http://smus.com/responsive-vr/).
5. You're done! Dance party!

**All *my* code & art is dedicated to the public domain.**
